// SECTION ONE: SETTING UP THE GAME BOARD AND PLAYER
//
// Overview:
// - Define the board's width and height.
// - Build out the player, including what it is and how it will look on the board.
// - Create a game board using a HashMap to represent coordinates (x, y).
// - Place the player at a specific (x, y) position on the game board.
//
// Recap:
// By the end of this section, we will have a game board with a player displayed on it.

// TASK #01: Define Game Board Dimensions
// - Use two constants to represent the board's width and height (type: u32).
// - Since the board dimensions are fixed, use `const` as it ensures the variables remain immutable.
// - Set their values to your desired board width and height. For example: 10x10, 20x20, etc.
