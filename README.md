# Learn to Build a Terminal-based Galaga Game in Rust! 🚀🛸✨

Welcome to our **experimental course** where we dive deep into the fundamentals of **Rust programming** by building a **Galaga-inspired terminal shooter**! This project is more than just a fun experiment; it's written to be as polished as possible, ensuring you learn **best practices** while writing clean, maintainable Rust code.

---

## Overview

**Galaga** has been a classic arcade shooter for decades, and we're bringing it to the terminal. Throughout this course, you'll learn to recreate this retro masterpiece **step-by-step**. Buckle up, because we’ll be exploring:

- Rust's strong emphasis on safety and performance, making it perfect for game development.
- Handling terminal graphics without GUI libraries.
- Game programming basics like:
    - Ship movement and controls.
    - Enemy spawning and behavior.
    - Projectile motion.
    - Collision detection.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers unparalleled control, safety, and speed. It's gaining immense popularity in the **game development and systems programming** space. By working on this course:

1. **Foundation for Rust**: You'll establish a strong command over Rust concepts.
2. **Real-World Experience**: Develop a hands-on feel for working on terminal-based applications.
3. **Step into Game Dev**: Learn the essence of game programming by tackling real problems.

## What We'll Build 🚀

By the end of this course, you’ll have a **complete terminal-based Galaga game** featuring:

- **Player-controlled spaceship** with precise and responsive controls.
- **Waves of enemies** spawning in different patterns.
- **Laser projectiles**, both fired by the player and enemies.
- **Simple AI** for enemy movement.
- A **score system** and end-state detection.

But more importantly, you'll understand the **"how and why"** of implementing these features in Rust.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have:

1. **Rust installed**: Follow the official guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to set up Rust.
2. **Basic Rust knowledge**: You don’t need to be an expert, but understanding concepts like variables, loops, and functions will help.
3. **Terminal access**: Since this is a terminal-based game, you’ll need a terminal emulator (e.g., CMD, Bash, Zsh).

## Project Setup 📂

To get started, clone this repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GandalfTheGrey-DEV/galaga_course.git
cd galaga-rust-tutorial
```

Then, build and run the starter template:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will generate a simple "Hello, World!" placeholder. From here, we'll build our Galaga game step by step.

## Course Structure 🎮

This course is divided into digestible lessons. Each lesson adds new features to our game while explaining **concepts and techniques** in Rust. Here's a quick outline:

### 1. **Setting the Stage** 🌌
- Build the project scaffolding.
- Understand terminal-based graphics.
- Display a static player spaceship in the terminal.

### 2. **Player Movement** 🛸
- Handle input using Rust’s `crossterm` or similar library.
- Implement horizontal movement for the player spaceship.

### 3. **Laser Cannons** 🔫
- Add player laser projectiles.
- Create clean and reusable projectile systems.

### 4. **Enemy Waves** 🐜
- Spawn enemy ships at randomized intervals.
- Implement simple enemy movement.

### 5. **Collision Detection** 🎯
- Detect when lasers hit enemies.
- Remove destroyed enemies and track the score.

### 6. **Polishing the Game** ✨
- Add finishing touches: victory/defeat states, improved UI, and difficulty scaling.
